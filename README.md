# My_Portfolio_129
Hello, I'm Dip Ghosh, a 3rd-year B.Tech student at NIT Durgapur. I am passionate about management and operational roles, often finding myself more drawn to strategic and logistical tasks than purely technical work. With an enthusiasm for learning, I actively seek out new challenges that broaden my understanding and skill set.

Beyond academics, I'm an avid guitar player and enjoy staying active through regular workouts, which helps me maintain focus and discipline. I believe my proactive nature and eagerness to learn have shaped me into a reliable team player, ready to contribute meaningfully to any project. Being part of leadership roles in college clubs, such as managing events and operations for CCA E-Cell, has given me hands-on experience in organizing, planning, and executing tasks effectively.

Driven by curiosity and dedication, I aim to build a career that leverages my passion for management while continuously expanding my knowledge and skills.
